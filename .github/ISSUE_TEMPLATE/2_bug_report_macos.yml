      description: >
          Try to reproduce your issue with `--no-config` first. If it isn't reproducible
          with `--no-config` try to find out which option or script causes your issue.

          If the issue is performance-related, try to reproduce it with `--no-config
          --profile=fast`, which is designed to work on lower-end mobile devices.
          Additionally, enable hardware decoding with `--hwdec=yes` or the `Ctrl+h` shortcut.

          Describe the reproduction steps as precise as possible. It's very likely that
          the bug you experience wasn't reproduced by the developer because the workflow
          differs from your own.

          Make a log file made with `-v -v` or `--log-file=output.txt`, attach it to
          the issue. If you use the Bundle, a default log is created for your last run at
          `~/Library/Logs/mpv.log`. You can jump to that file via the `Help > Show log Fileâ€¦`
          menu.

          In the case of a crash, please provide the macOS Crash Report (Backtrace).

          Without the log file, this issue will be closed for ignoring the issue template.

          Sample files needed to reproduce this issue can be attached to the issue
          (preferred), or be uploaded to https://0x0.st/ or similar sites.
          (Only needed if the issue cannot be reproduced without it.)
          Do not use garbage like "cloud storage", especially not Google Drive.
