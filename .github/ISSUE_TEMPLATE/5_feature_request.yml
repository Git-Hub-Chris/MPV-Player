          Even if you think it's not necessary at first, it might help us later to find
          possible issues. Make a log file with `--log-file=output.txt`, which is our preferred way,
          and attach it to the issue.


          If you have trouble producing a log file, you can alternatively use `-v -v`, save the
          terminal output to a file, and attach it to the issue.
