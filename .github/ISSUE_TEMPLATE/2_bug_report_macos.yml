          If you're not using git master or the latest release, update.
          Releases are listed [here](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/releases).

      description: >
          Try to reproduce your issue with `--no-config` first. If it isn't reproducible
          with `--no-config` try to find out which option or script causes your issue.


          If the issue is render performance-related, try to reproduce it with `--no-config
          --profile=fast`, which is designed to work on lower-end mobile devices.


          For decoding performance-related issues, additionally try to enable hardware
          decoding with `--hwdec=yes` or the `Ctrl+h` shortcut.


          Describe the reproduction steps as precise as possible. It's very likely that
          the bug you experience wasn't reproduced by the developer because the workflow
          differs from your own.

          Make a log file made with `-v -v` or `--log-file=output.txt`, attach it to
          the issue. If you use the Bundle, a default log is created for your last run at
          `~/Library/Logs/mpv.log`. You can jump to that file via the `Help > Show log Fileâ€¦`
          menu.

          In the case of a crash, please provide the macOS Crash Report (Backtrace).

          Without the log file, this issue will be closed for ignoring the issue template.
