      Describe the reproduction steps as precise as possible. It's very likely that
      the bug you experience wasn't reproduced by the developer because the workflow
      differs from your own.

      Make a log file made with -v -v or --log-file=output.txt. If you use the Bundle
      from a version later than 0.32 a default log is created for your last run at
      ~/Library/Logs/mpv.log. You can jump to that file via the Help > Show log Fileâ€¦
      menu. Paste the log to https://0x0.st/ or attach it to the github issue.
      In the case of a crash please provide the macOS Crash Report (Backtrace).

      Sample files needed to reproduce this issue can be uploaded to https://0x0.st/
      or similar sites. (Only needed if the issue cannot be reproduced without it.)
      Do not use garbage like "cloud storage", especially not Google Drive.
